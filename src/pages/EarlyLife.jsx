          <p>Julius Robert Oppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, in New York City to Ella, a painter, and Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer, a wealthy textile importer who immigrated from Hanau, Prussia, in 1888. Raised in a non-observant Jewish family, he had a younger brother, Frank, who also became a physicist. In 1912, the family moved to a luxurious apartment on Riverside Drive, New York, and amassed an impressive art collection featuring works by Picasso, Vuillard, and Van Gogh.</p>

          <p>Oppenheimer began his education at Alcuin Preparatory School before attending the Ethical Culture Society School in 1911, founded by Felix Adler to emphasize "Deed before Creed." A gifted and versatile student, he excelled in literature, mineralogy, and music, studying flute with renowned French flutist Georges Barr√®re. Academically advanced, he skipped grades and graduated in 1921. His education was briefly delayed due to colitis, contracted during a family trip to Joachimstal, Czechoslovakia. While recovering in New Mexico, he developed a passion for horseback riding and the Southwest.</p>
